# SavingMortyFECA2
Fanmade parody game of 1st episode of 4th season from the Adult Swim produced TV series called Rick and Morty 
Game mechanics inspired by Club Penguin, DOOM (1993) and space invader

Specific details of inspiration:

Club Penguin: It was last owned by Walt Disney. It's an MMORPG game with lots of cool events, activities and mini games to play solo or with friends.
Specifically level 3 of the mini game called Puffle rescue was where i was inspired. The zooming in and out animation gave me the idea for the space cats.

I have attached the link below to refer how the zoom in and out animation works with that game's mechanics

DOOM (1993): The POV that Doom's mechanics revolved around itself inspired me to make my spaceship into first person perspective
File attached below is a screenshot taken from google images just to show the gameplay look of 'DOOM (1993)'

Space invader: The enemy mechanics was inspired from space invader. As you can see, that in the other games, enemies don't approach until you move forward. Instead, Having enemies approach me made it more easier to make.

The whole game revolves around Rick and Morty, Hence many resources are directly taken from frames of the show. The Intro song in the homepage is the intro music of show

Only few miscaleanous files were added. 1) Main background soundtrack is by Obliveon's 'From This Day Forward'. 2)Tom's screams from Tom and Jerry for the space cats. 3) Spaceship photo was randomly found in pinterest, I heavily editted it for my purposes. 4) The space picture was too found in pinterest
